# A Game of Numbers Based on Model RB

If you have any comments or want to know more about the following game, please send me an email.

---

In what follows, we propose a game of numbers based on Model RB. This game, a logic puzzle similar to Sudoku, consists of a grid with *n* rows and *n* columns where *n* is a natural number. There are totally *n*² squares in the grid, each of which contains some different numbers.

The task of the game is to select **exactly one square from each row** such that the *n* selected squares contain **no repeated numbers**, i.e. no number appears in more than one square of the *n* selected ones.  
If you successfully complete this task, then you win the game.

Is this game interesting and easy to understand? If so, why not have a try on the following game now.
